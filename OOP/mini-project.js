/* 

Objectives
Use the new JS object-oriented programming skills to create an "Event" class.
Write functions on the "Event" class that will:
allow the event host to add tickets with prices and "ticket type" (e.g. regular, VIP, mezzanine, balcony, etc)
allows a user to input a price range they are willing to pay to see what ticket types are available to them
Create a few event objects
Push the event objects into an array and use jQuery to display the list of events to an html page.
